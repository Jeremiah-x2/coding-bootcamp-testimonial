## My process

I started out with the markup first, and after that I proceeded to the styling. Since I used tailwindcss, I took the mobile-first workflow, which is usually don't follow when using pure CSS

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- TailwindCSS Flexbox
- TailwindCSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt how to use tailwindcss better at making responsive webpages and usin the mobile-first workflow which I usually don't use when working with pure css

### Continued development

I would mostly focus on using tailwind grid for layout and also javascript for manipulating data.
